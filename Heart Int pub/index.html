        <div class="intro-content">
          <p>The Heart Initiative is a non-profit organization created in 2009 whose mission is, through research, to: </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Increase public awareness and knowledge of cardiovascular diseases particularly heart failure </li>
                <li>Improve the early diagnosis and treatment of cardiovascular diseases, through increasing usage of proven therapies and improving adherence.</li>
              </ul>
          <p>Our initial focus was in sub-Saharan Africa where public attention, research, intervention and funding has been focused on infectious and parasitic diseases, despite the fact that cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality rates nearly equal those from infectious and parasitic diseases and will surpass them by 2020.  And, in sub-Saharan Africa, cardiovascular disorders affect women and men in their prime (ages 40-50) impeding their ability to work and care for their families.</p>

          <p>Heart failure is a global health burden, both socially and financially.  Data have shown that inexpensive, proven, life-saving medications are underutilized on every continent.  While research identifying new, effective therapies is certainly important, resources could be directed towards finding ways to enhance uptake of therapies that have already been proven to improve cardiovascular health.</p>

        <p>Data have shown that oral medications proven to prolong survival and/or reduce readmissions are underutilized by patients as well as under-prescribed by physicians.  The Safety, Tolerability and Efficacy of Rapid Optimization, Helped by NT-proBNP and GDF-15, of Heart Failure Therapies (STRONG-HF) study is a randomized, controlled study comparing a strategy designed to encourage physicians to optimize doses of these guideline-recommended medications as soon as possible following discharge from a hospital admission for acute heart failure, with the usual care strategy.  The safe up-titrations of these medications will be guided by frequent physical assessments as well as laboratory measures. Funding is being provided in part by Roche Diagnostics International Ltd.</p>

      <div class="section-description">
        <p><strong>Brief Summary:</strong> STRONG-HF is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of up-titration of standard oral heart failure medications during hospitalization for acute heart failure. Patients admitted for acute heart failure will be randomized 1-2 days before discharge to either usual care or intensification of treatment with a beta-blocker, a renin-angiotensin system blocker, and a mineralocorticoid receptor blocker (“high intensity care” arm). In the “high intensity care” arm, patients’ clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure will be assessed, and routine laboratory measures and biomarkers will be measured, at frequent post-discharge visits. When these measures indicate that it is safe to do so, the doses of the oral heart failure medications will be increased to optimal levels. Patients will be followed through 90 days from randomization. Patients assigned to the usual care group will be followed by their general physician and/or cardiologist according to local medical standards. All patients, including those who were screened but did not meet eligibility criteria, will be followed for 90-day outcome.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Detailed Description:</strong> STRONG-HF is a multicenter, randomized, parallel group study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of up-titration of standard of care medical therapy including beta-blockers; acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (ACEi), angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) or angiotensin receptor neprolysin inhibitor (ARNi); and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist (MRAs), on morbidity and mortality when initiated and up-titrated early during hospitalization for acute heart failure (AHF). Optimal safety conditions will allow physicians to introduce and/or continue oral HF therapies during this “vulnerable phase” in AHF patients. Patients admitted for AHF with clinical signs of congestion and elevated circulating N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) and who are not treated with optimal doses of oral heart failure (HF) therapies 1-2 days before hospital discharge for AHF and who are hemodynamically stable will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either usual care (named “usual care” arm) or intensification of treatment with beta-blockers, and ACEi (or ARB) or ARNi and a MRA (named “high intensity care” arm). In the latter arm, repeated assessments of clinical signs and symptoms of heart failure, routine clinical laboratory measures including potassium, sodium, and creatinine as well as biomarkers including NT-ProBNP and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) will foster, encourage and ensure the safety of the optimization of oral heart failure therapies. Patients will be followed through 90 days from randomization. AHF patients who were screened but did not meet inclusion criteria, including low circulating NT-proBNP at visit 2, will also be followed for 90-day outcome.

        <p>The Heart Initiative, in collaboration with principal scientists from the THESUS-HF study, organized the BA-HEF Study (Bi treatment with hydralazine/nitrates vs. placebo in Africans admitted with acute HEart Failure), which was completed in 2015 (Sliwa et al. 2016).</p>

        <p>The study was one of the first (if not the first) randomized, placebo-controlled trial of a medication conducted entirely in patients with acute heart failure in sub-Saharan Africa.  The study did not demonstrate that the hydralazine/nitrate combination reduced the 6-month risk of death or HF readmission but did suggest effects in favor of the combination on easing breathing symptoms 1 week after admission, and on decreases in systolic blood pressure and weight and improved exercise capacity after 6 months.   Support for the study was provided in part by Momentum Research, Inc., Sandoz South Africa, and Novartis Pharma AG.</p>

      <div class="section-description">
        <p>When the Heart Initiative was established, a consortium of African cardiologists and heart failure experts were conducting a registry of patients admitted to the hospital for heart failure in 9 African countries called the THESUS-HF Study (The Sub-Saharan Africa Survey of Heart Failure) (Damasceno et al. 2012). This study aimed to characterize acute heart failure in Africa by describing the causes, treatment, and outcomes over 6 months of follow-up. THESUS-HF shows that survival and readmission rates of African patients with acute heart failure are similar to those observed in non-African registries, and that much of the heart failure in Africa is caused by uncontrolled hypertension, a disease that tends to affect people at a younger age than other causes of heart disease.  Despite the availability of generic and inexpensive anti-hypertensive drugs, hypertension remains untreated in much of Africa.  Future research could be directed towards improving routine blood pressure screening and hypertension treatment in these countries.
        </p>

        <p>THESUS-HF also showed that patients in Africa are rarely treated with a combination of hydralazine and nitrates, which was proven in the A-HeFT to prolong survival in African Americans. The study data have contributed to our understanding of heart failure globally, with several manuscripts published based on THESUS-HF:</p>
